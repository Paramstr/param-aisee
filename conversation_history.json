Make sure each piece is correctly identified and matched with the corresponding part in your instructions.\n\n2. **Orientation**: Pay attention to the orientation of the panels. Sometimes, a simple mistake like placing a panel upside down can make assembly much more difficult.\n\n3. **Hardware**: The hardware, such as screws or bolts, should be used as specified in the instructions. Tightening them too much or too little can cause issues with the stability of the assembled furniture.\n\n4. **Sequence**: The order in which you assemble the pieces is crucial. Make sure you are following the recommended sequence to avoid having to disassemble parts later.\n\nIf you can describe any specific issues you're encountering or provide a close-up photo of the parts you're unsure about, I can offer more detailed guidance.
